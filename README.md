# ðŸ“š LangChain Learning Journey

Personal learning repository for [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/), a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). This repo documents my progress as I explore LangChain's features, take notes from the official docs, and build hands-on examples.

## ðŸš€ What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build context-aware, reasoning-capable applications powered by LLMs. It provides modules for chaining together prompts, tools, memory, agents, and more â€” enabling truly powerful AI workflows.

> _Think of LangChain as the glue between LLMs and real-world apps._
